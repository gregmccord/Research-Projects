Princeton Research Projects from COS424 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains 4 projects that I worked on throughout my machine
learning course at Princeton. All files contained within have been
pre-approved by Professor Engelhardt.

These projects are provided to demonstrate my research and analytical
abilities. The papers naturally grow more complex through the semester and
were written in the following order:
1. Classification of Customer Reviews using Sentiment Analysis Techniques
2. Prediction of Outcomes for Children of Fragile Families
3. Netflix Genre-Based Movie Prediction
4. Inferring Movie Characteristics from Dialogue

The fourth project - Inferring Movie Characteristics from Dialogue - was
a truly independent research project. The project grew from a research
proposal to the analysis to a poster session to a final research paper.
